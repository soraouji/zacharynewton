description: I ended up building out a portfolio website for a colleague friend of
  mine. I really liked working on this one because I got to flex some tiny css grid
  muscles while teaching myself how to actually use it. Plus I got to implement some
  fun new things on a smaller project that wasnâ€™t just a personal project that would
  end up sitting on my hard drive.
