  I ended up building out a portfolio website for a colleague friend of mine. I really liked working on this one because I got to flex some tiny CSS grid muscles while teaching myself how to actually use it. Plus I got to implement some fun new things on a smaller project that wasnâ€™t just a personal project that would end up sitting on my hard drive.
